    <p><strong>Hi</strong>, I'm Lucian Marin.</p>
    <p>
        I have a background in electronics engineering and currently doing what I love, designing and building amazing products. I dare to like meticulous design, modern typography, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://soundcloud.com/lucianmarin/likes">electronic music</a> and strict engineering. I strongly think that design is all about making impossible possible.

        Some things are written in 日本語 because I'm a fan of Japanese culture and art. I don't know the language, but I hope I get the chance to learn it one day.
