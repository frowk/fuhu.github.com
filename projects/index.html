        <h2>Linux Kernel<br>
        </h2>
        Yes. Don't be too surprised. Currently I am really working on <a
            href="http://www.kernel.org">Linux kernel project</a>. I have
        submitted several patches to <a href="http://www.lkml.org">the kernel list</a>.
        You can find them in the <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=summary">linus-tree</a>.
        <br>
        <h2>KVM</h2>
        <a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/">KVM</a> (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko. KVM also requires a modified QEMU although work is underway to get the required changes upstream.
        <br>
        <h2>QEMU</h2>
        <a href="http://qemu.org/">QEMU</a> is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.
        <br>
        <h2>Corosync</h2>
        The <a href="http://www.corosync.org">Corosync</a> Cluster Engine is a Group Communication System with additional features for implementing high availability within applications. The project provides four C Application Programming Interface features.
        <br>
        <h2>Pacemaker</h2>
        <a href="http://clusterlabs.org">Pacemaker</a> is an Open Source, High Availability resource manager suitable for both small and large clusters.
        <br>
        <h2>Documentation: <i>Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide</i></h2>
        <p><i>Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide</i> is a very good guide
        for kernel newbies to learn. It introduces how to write a Linux kernel
        module step by step and is easy to study.</p>
        <p>
        I found some mistakes in the original <i>Linux Kernel Module
            Programming Guide</i> and made some comments for one part of it. But
        the maintainer did not reply me until now.
        Also, I revised the Chinese version of <i>Linux Kernel Module
            Programming Guide</i>.
        My work was based on the previous translator's contribution. What I do
        was just update and correction.
        Note that copyright of the Chinese version belongs to the former
        translator, <b>TIAN Jing</b>. It is available <a
            href="../articles/lkmpg_cn/index.htm">here</a>. If you find any mistake
        in it or want to join us, please send me a mail.
